# Procedural JavaScript
## JavaScript History (5m)
  * Created by Brandon Eich at Netscape in 10 days in 1995
  * Functional and OO
  * Browser Wars leave us with legacy weirdness
  * ES6 and ES2015 are one and the same
  * Mention idea of transpiling, we use the features of the language we want, translate it into something all browsers understand
## Basics of how JS is being run (5m)
  * Runs directly in the client (unlike ERB all put together on server and sent back as a string)
  * script tags with inline JS
  * script tags with src attribute
  * DOM API (not in-depth)
## JavaScript Syntax (what's the same; what's different) (10m)
  * Variable declaration vs. variable assignment
  * Objects (dot notation vs. bracket notation)
  * Explicit returns
  * for loop syntax
## How to do the Labs (5m)
  * Mocha runs in browser, get used to working with code there
  * console.log
  * debugger (need console open)
## Functions are first class objects (10m)
  * They're objects
  * Can do anything you can do with other objects
  * Store in variables
  * Pass as arguments to other functions
  * Return from functions
  * Arrow Function
## Callbacks (10m)
  * Compare to Ruby blocks
  * inline anonymous vs. named
  * map, filter, forEach
## Closures (10m)
  * Function draws a bubble around everything that's in scope at time it is defined
  * How we create 'private' variables
  * Tiny bit on currying
## Scope (10m)
  * `var`
  * `let`
  * `const`
  * Hoisting
