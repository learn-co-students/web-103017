  * Outside resources (tutorials, books, videos) are great
    * Doing the readings and lab from the program will keep you up to pace
* Procedural programming
  * Less organization
  * Writing code line by line
  * Using functions (procedurs) to reuse pieces of code
* Object-oriented programming
  * Ruby based off of (by default)
